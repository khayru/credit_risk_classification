 ## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
  The purpose of this analysis is to predict users will be at high-risk for loans.
  
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
  The dataset landing_csv    loan-healthy (low-rick) or non-healthy(high-risk)
  
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* 
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* # Check the balance of our target values
y.value_counts()
0    75036
1     2500
Name: loan_status, dtype: int64
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).
the method uses LogisticRegression
Step 3: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance by doing the following:
Calculate the accuracy score of the model.

Generate a confusion matrix.

Print the classification report.

# Print the balanced_accuracy score of the model
logistic_score = balanced_accuracy_score(y_test, prediction_testing)
print(logistic_score)
0.9442676901753825
# Generate a confusion matrix for the model
logistic_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, prediction_testing)
print(logistic_matrix)
[[18679    80]
 [   67   558]]

## Results


Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
    
1- according to the machine learning model, I got the results 
2- The accuracy score for this model is 0.99 score

* The precision score for this model is 0.99

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )
  
Based on the precision or I think this will be a good  model to put into practice because the score is 0.9 accuracy is a good score.

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
I don't think this model can be predicted for the model because the accuracy score of 80%that means every  100 people get 20 mis labels this creates a lot of lost
test scores the one very summary of the training score.
